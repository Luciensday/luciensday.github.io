# Portfolio Website 

**Intro**

This is my portfolio website in which you will learn a little bit of me and why i wish to become a Software Developer. In the meantime my projects and learned/followed tutorial are also showcase in the site. 

**Little twists in Javascript**
1. Try to hover over the text "Hi, I'm Lucien Lin". you will see the hollwed effect on the hovered letter!
2. The website is responsive.  Navbar will adjust to three clickable-bar to fit the small screen.
