            <p class="paragraph-content"> Hey, I'm Lucien! These days, I work as a Footwear Designer and occasionally dabble in travel planning. I'm all about embracing challenges and constantly expanding my horizons.  There's just something incredibly satisfying about the sense of accomplishment that comes with learning new things.
        During my free time, I love exploring the great outdoors and going on invigorating hikes. One of my most memorable adventures was a 12-day trek in Cotswold. But I am not all about natural.. sometimes I getting lost in a seemingly endless scroll of adorable cat videos. </p>

         <h2 class="paragraph-title" >Why
        Software Development? </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-content">
            I've always been filled with ideas for solving problems and improving existing concepts, especially when I encounter manual processes in my work. However, I never really considered coding as something for me. That is, until I heard the inspiring story of my friend, who taught themselves to code without a computer science degree. It sparked something within me, and I decided to give it a shot.
            It's been a month since I delved into the world of coding, the more I learn about coding,, the more exhilarating it becomes. I find immense joy in the process of tackling JavaScript questions and attempting to crack them. Every time I come across a masterful solution, I can't help but aspire to reach that level one day.
            My ultimate goal is to become a software developer who creates meaningful software that helps people. It's what drives me and keeps me motivated on this journey.I've always been filled with ideas for solving problems and improving existing concepts, especially when I encounter manual processes in my work.
